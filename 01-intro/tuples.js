// Tuples are usually used when we want to data in a specific format like in array the 1st element should be string, 2nd be number.
var user = ["Connor", 123, false];
// user = ["Connor", false, 23]; // Not allowed
user = ["Edward", 23, true]; // Allowed
var color1 = [234, 123, 222];
color1.push(233); // One of the defects of tuple.
console.log(color1);
